### Brain Games: [the first project](https://ru.hexlet.io/programs/python/projects/49) for the [Hexlet Python course](https://ru.hexlet.io/programs/python) 

**The Brain Games project** is a Terminal trinket
consisting of five math games, three rounds each. 
Using randomly generated values, they go like this:
1. Find out if the given number is even or not;
2. Calculate the expression (add, substract, divide);
3. Find the greatest common divisor of the pair;
4. Fill in an arithmetic progression;
5. Find out if the number is prime or not.

Due to the repeating logic, the project has a common game flow
that builds up the games based on their rules described in the modules.

*All of this is mostly me learning to wrap up projects nicely and getting into coding best practices.*
